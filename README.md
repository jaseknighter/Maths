# Maths

An SC implementation of the MakeNoise Maths EuroRack module. Creates a logarithmic to exponential curve function that can be triggered or can oscillate. The function starts at 0, goes to 1, and returns to 0 on each iteration or loop.

The source code for the no longer used Faust implementation of the UGen is provided and can be compiled for SC, PD, Max, or other environments.
